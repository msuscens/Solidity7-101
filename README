Ethereum Smart Contract Programming 101 Course (Ivan on Tech Blockchain Academy)
[Solidity version 7]

This is the solidity code developed during the course:
1. Bank & Government contract solidity assignment code.
2. MultiSig Wallet project - for assignment brief see that directory's README file.

Notes:
i) Remix was used throughout the course (including for MultiSig Wallet project)
to develop and run solidity code.
ii) Solidity 7 was employed, as opposed to 'Blockchain Developer Bootcamp'
where I used an earlier version of solidity (Solidity 5).
